= dnif

dnif is the new find... for sphinx

dnif is a gem to index data using ActiveRecord finders (for now), letting you index custom methods and not only table columns

== Usage

  require "dnif"

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base

    define_index do
      field :full_name
      field :email
      attribute :created_at, :type => :datetime

      where ["active = ?", false]
    end

    def full_name
      self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
    end
  end

  rake dnif:configure
  rake dnif:index
  rake dnif:start

  User.search("Rafael Souza")

== TODO

- Better error handler
- Try to remove ActiveRecord dependency, making it work with others ORMs/ODMs/etc
- Documentation
- Improve test suite
- Support to delta index (or something like that)
- Remove the class_name (seems not be necessary anymore)
- Move this TODO to Issues
